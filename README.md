# MotionPNGTuber

> **Developer Preview --- 2026/04/10 Experimental Build**
> This is a development snapshot. Features and APIs may change without notice.

**Beyond PNGTuber, before Live2D** --- Video-based real-time lip sync system

By using looping video, you can achieve rich expressions like **hair swaying** and **clothing fluttering** that traditional PNGTubers can't deliver. No specialized knowledge like Live2D is required --- just an MP4 video and mouth sprites to get started.

## 📢 Updates

| Date | Details |
|------|---------|
| 2026/04/13 | Fixed a critical bug where selecting a video in **Create mouth PNG sprites** could immediately fail with `Analysis error` because the auto detector script path was resolved incorrectly. Added a regression test for script-path lookup |
| 2026/04/10 | **Developer snapshot release**. HUD display now defaults to OFF. Internal refactoring and bug fixes |
| 2026/04/05 | **Ubuntu 22.04 experimental support** (Linux microphone input now available). **Added mouth PNG color correction** (brightness/saturation/color temperature sliders + auto-correction button). Improved GUI stability |
| 2026/04/04 | Improved GUI usability. Fixed file opening and Japanese path issues on Mac. Added mouth placement margin factor to advanced settings. Added **lightweight preview** to check appearance before full export |
| 2026/04/03 | Improved mouth PNG extraction GUI usability |
| 2026/01/09 | Migrated package management to **uv** |

> **⚠️ Installation Notice (2026-06) — `download.openmmlab.com` is offline**
>
> The domain that hosted pre-built `mmcv-full` wheels is no longer reachable globally.
> `uv sync` has been updated to work around this, but extra steps are needed per platform:
>
> | Platform | What changed | Action required |
> |----------|-------------|-----------------|
> | **Windows** | Wheel now fetched from Wayback Mirror | `rm uv.lock` then `uv sync` (first run downloads ~155 MB via Wayback) |
> | **Linux** | No archived wheel → builds from source | `MMCV_WITH_OPS=1 FORCE_CUDA=0 uv sync` (takes ~5-10 min) |
> | **Google Colab** | Use `colab_setup.py` | See [Google Colab](#google-colab-cpu) section below |
> | **macOS** | No change | Existing source-build procedure |
>
> Long-term fix: once `mmcv-full` wheels are hosted on GitHub Releases, `uv sync` will work on all platforms without extra steps.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 (uv installs it automatically — having Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 on your machine is fine)
- uv (package manager)
  - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
  - macOS / Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### 3 Steps to Try

```bash
# 1. Install
uv sync

# 2. Launch GUI
uv run python mouth_track_gui.py

# 3. Try with samples
#    Video: assets/asmr_tomari/asmr_loop.mp4
#    Mouth: assets/asmr_tomari/mouth
#    → (1) Analyze → Calibrate → (2) Generate mouthless video → (3) Live run
```

> Note: some older articles still refer to `assets01` / `assets03`. The current sample set on `main` is `assets/asmr_tomari/`.

## 🔧 Installation

### Windows

<details open>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

#### 1. Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (check "Add Python to PATH" during installation)
- uv:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

#### 2. Install

```bash
# Run in the project directory
uv sync
```

#### 3. Verify

```bash
uv run python -c "import cv2; import torch; print('OK')"
```

</details>

### macOS (Experimental)

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand (Apple Silicon: M1/M2/M3/M4)</b></summary>

#### 1. Install uv

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### 2. Prepare pyproject.toml

macOS uses a dedicated dependency file (the default `pyproject.toml` contains dependencies that are not compatible with macOS).

```sh
cp pyproject.toml pyproject.win.toml
cp pyproject.macos.toml pyproject.toml
```

#### 3. Base packages

```sh
uv venv .venv && uv sync
uv pip install pip setuptools wheel torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2
```

#### 4. Build xtcocotools from source

```sh
mkdir -p deps && cd deps
git clone https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi.git
cd xtcocoapi && ../../.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e . && cd ../..
```

#### 5. Build mmcv-full from source (~5 minutes)

```sh
cd deps
curl -L https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/archive/refs/tags/v1.7.0.tar.gz -o mmcv-1.7.0.tar.gz
tar xzf mmcv-1.7.0.tar.gz && cd mmcv-1.7.0
MMCV_WITH_OPS=1 FORCE_CUDA=0 ../../.venv/bin/python setup.py develop
MMCV_WITH_OPS=1 FORCE_CUDA=0 ../../.venv/bin/python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ../..
```

#### 6. Remaining packages

```sh
uv pip install --no-build-isolation anime-face-detector
uv pip install mmdet==2.28.0 mmpose==0.29.0
```

#### 7. Launch

```sh
.venv/bin/python mouth_track_gui.py
```

#### Notes

- Do not delete the `deps/` directory
- Use `+`/`-` keys for calibration zoom (scroll wheel may not work)

</details>

### Ubuntu 22.04 (Experimental)

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand (x86_64 / NVIDIA)</b></summary>

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Python 3.10
- NVIDIA GPU / CUDA 11.7 compatible environment recommended

#### 2. Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### 3. System packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libportaudio2 pulseaudio-utils
```

#### 4. Install

```bash
uv sync
```

#### 5. Verify

```bash
uv run python -c "import cv2; import torch; print('OK')"
```

#### 6. Launch

```bash
uv run python mouth_track_gui.py
```

#### Notes

- Linux audio input enumeration can differ from Windows/macOS.
- If your USB mic does not appear as a normal `sd:` device, try a `pa:... (via pulse)` item in the audio list.
- If `pactl` is unavailable, Linux audio fallback support is limited.

</details>

### Google Colab (CPU)

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand (no GPU required)</b></summary>

Run MotionPNGTuber analysis in Google Colab without any local install.
The detector runs on **CPU** — no GPU runtime needed.

#### How to use

1. Open [`colab_setup.py`](colab_setup.py) in this repo and copy-paste each `# %%` block into a **separate Colab code cell**.
2. Run cells in order: **Cell 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8** to complete the install.
3. Use **Cell 9** to upload a video and run the face detector → produces `mouth_track.npz`.
4. Use **Cell 10** to download the results to your machine.

#### Key notes

- **Cell 6** (build `mmcv-full` from source) takes **~5-10 minutes** — do not interrupt it.
- **Cell 9** (first detector run) downloads model weights **~300 MB** — needs network.
- If the Colab runtime restarts between cells, **re-run Cell 2** to restore `uv` in PATH before continuing.
- The install does **not** use `uv sync` / `pyproject.toml` — all packages are installed manually so it works regardless of the repo's lockfile state.

#### Why CPU mode?

`mmcv-full 1.7.0` was built for CUDA 11.7 / PyTorch 1.13, but Colab's default runtime uses CUDA 12.x / PyTorch 2.x — the pre-built GPU wheels no longer exist. Building with `FORCE_CUDA=0` produces a CPU-only `mmcv-full` that is fully compatible with the detector. Processing is slower (~1-3s per frame) but reliable.

## 🎮 Usage

### Main GUI

```bash
uv run python mouth_track_gui.py
```

> 📝 On macOS, set up dependencies via the [macOS installation steps](#macos-experimental) before launching.

#### Workflow

1. **Create mouth PNG sprites** --- only if the mouth folder doesn't exist yet
2. **Select video** → choose a loop video
3. **Select mouth folder** → choose the folder containing mouth sprites
4. **(1) Analyze → Calibrate** → adjust mouth position and press Space to confirm ([controls](#calibration-controls))
5. **Visual check (lightweight)** → preview margin factor / mouth-erase range without full export
6. **(2) Generate mouthless video** → generates video with mouth erased
7. **(3) Live run** → speak into the mic and the mouth moves!
8. **If the mouth color looks off** → press auto color-blending or adjust sliders manually ([details](#mouth-png-color-correction))

#### Default Settings (changed 2026/04/10)

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Shadow blending (mouth erase) | Smoothly blends the boundary where the mouth was erased, making seams less noticeable | ON |
| HUD display | Shows FPS, mouth open/close state, and other info on screen during live run | OFF |

Both can be toggled via checkboxes in the GUI. If a value is already saved in the session, the saved value takes precedence.

---

### 🖌️ Mouth PNG Creation GUI

```bash
uv run python mouth_sprite_extractor_gui.py
```

If you don't have a mouth folder yet, it's recommended to create one here first.
You can also launch it from the "Create mouth PNG sprites (recommended)" button in the main GUI.
During analysis after selecting a video, the **Processing Status** area at the top shows the current step with a progress bar.

---

### 🔍 Visual Check (Lightweight)

A preview for quickly checking the **margin factor** and **mouth-erase range** before exporting the full mouthless video.

- Uses existing `mouth_track.npz` / `mouth_track_calibrated.npz` as-is, so you can skip heavy processing
- If `open.png` is found, you can also see how the mouth PNG overlays
- Press `Enter` to apply the selected settings to the GUI
- ⚠️ If you change the margin factor, you need to re-run **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**

#### Key Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Top buttons / `1` `2` `3` | Select margin factor candidate |
| `r` / `f` | Increase / decrease mouth-erase range |
| `a` / `d` | Previous / next frame |
| `[` / `]` | Jump 10 frames back / forward |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| Apply to GUI button / `Enter` | Apply margin factor / mouth-erase range to GUI |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close without applying |

---

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings

**Advanced settings can usually be left closed.**

The main setting is the **mouth placement margin factor**, which affects mouth placement size during **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**.

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Mouth PNG looks too small / edges are clipped | Increase slightly (e.g., `2.3` ~ `2.6`) |
| Mouth is too large / picks up jaw or cheeks | Decrease slightly (e.g., `1.8` ~ `2.0`) |

The default value of **`2.1`** usually works fine.

Recommended workflow:

1. Run **(1) Analyze → Calibrate** with `2.1`
2. **Visual check (lightweight)** --- compare values around `1.9 / 2.1 / 2.3`
3. Apply the best value → re-run **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**
4. Proceed to **(2) Generate mouthless video**

> ⚠️ The margin factor is used during analysis, so changing it requires re-running **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**.

---

### 🎨 Mouth PNG Color Correction

Adjusts color blending between mouth PNGs and the base video.
Moving the sliders during live run **reflects changes in real time (~hundreds of ms)** without restarting the runtime.

#### Adjustable Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mouth PNG brightness | Overall mouth brightness |
| Mouth PNG saturation | Color vividness |
| Mouth PNG warm/cool | Color temperature |
| Correction intensity | Overall correction strength |
| Edge priority | How strongly correction applies to mouth edges |
| Edge correction width | Range of edge correction effect |
| Preview: color diff highlight | Makes subtle color mismatches easier to spot (preview only; does not modify assets) |

> **How edge priority works**: Correction is not applied uniformly across the entire mouth PNG --- it applies more strongly to the outer edges.
> This helps reduce issues like "only the mouth edges look out of place" or "the skin boundary doesn't blend."

#### Auto Color Blending

Press the **"Auto color blending"** button during live run to automatically compare the background video's mouth area with the mouth PNG's edge colors and suggest correction values.
You can still fine-tune with sliders after auto-correction.

- Transparent areas of the mouth PNG are ignored; only the **colored edge areas** are analyzed
- The auto-correction button is **only available during live run**
- Changes are auto-saved

#### Recommended Workflow

1. Start **(3) Live run**
2. Optionally increase **color diff highlight** to check for color mismatches
3. Press **Auto color blending**
4. Fine-tune with sliders

<details>
<summary><b>🌐 Browser Output</b></summary>

After completing **(2) Generate mouthless video**, the following files are exported to the same folder:

- `mouth_track.json`
- `*_mouthless_h264.mp4` (if `ffmpeg` is found)

Use these when passing mouth track data to a browser implementation.

- `mouth_track.json` is the main track export
- `*_mouthless_h264.mp4` is recommended for browser / player use when `ffmpeg` is available
- If `ffmpeg` is missing, the GUI still exports `mouth_track.json` and logs that H.264 export was skipped

For **MotionPNGTuber_Player** and other browser implementations that use **AudioWorklet**, opening files via `file://` may block mic / worklet loading. In that case, serve the folder locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

<summary><b>❓ Troubleshooting</b></summary>

### Mouth position is misaligned

- First try **Recalibrate only**
- If still too small / too large, use **Visual check (lightweight)** to compare margin factor values
- Then adjust the **margin factor in advanced settings** slightly if needed

### Black smudge in mouth erase

- Try turning **Shadow blending** OFF

### `uv sync` fails

If you see an error about `download.openmmlab.com` (domain offline), the fix depends on your platform:

**Windows** — delete the stale lock file and re-sync (downloads wheel from Wayback Mirror, ~155 MB):
```bash
rm uv.lock
uv sync
```

**Linux** — build `mmcv-full` from source (~5-10 min):
```bash
rm uv.lock
MMCV_WITH_OPS=1 FORCE_CUDA=0 uv sync
```

**Google Colab** — use [`colab_setup.py`](colab_setup.py) instead of `uv sync`.

For other errors, try clearing the cache first:
```bash
uv cache clean
uv sync
```

### CUDA not recognized

```bash
uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

### Analysis stops on RTX 50-series / newer GPUs

- Root cause: the current Torch / CUDA build may not fully match your GPU architecture
- Prevention: the GUI now starts analysis with `--device auto`, which tries CUDA first and then CPU fallback
- If analysis still fails, rerun from CLI with `--device cpu` and check the log for CUDA compatibility messages

### Analysis looks frozen

- Initial analysis can take time, especially on long videos
- If GPU fallback switches to CPU, processing becomes much slower but is still expected
- Check the progress area and log before assuming the app has hung

### `Analysis error` appears immediately after selecting a video in the mouth PNG GUI

- Root cause (fixed on 2026-04-13): the GUI could fail before tracking started if the bundled detector script path was resolved incorrectly
- Prevention: the detector launcher now searches both the package directory and the repository root, and this lookup is covered by a regression test
- If you still see the error after updating, check the log pane for the exact exception and verify that `face_track_anime_detector.py` exists in the project

<summary><b>🎁 Bonus Tools</b></summary>

### Mouth Sprite Extraction CLI

```bash
uv run python mouth_sprite_extractor.py --video loop.mp4 --out mouth/
```

Extract mouth sprites (5 PNGs) directly from the command line without the GUI.
